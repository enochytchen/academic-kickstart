I am a Research Assistant of Biostatistics in the[Biostatistics Group](https://ki.se/en/meb/meb-biostatistics-group) at the Department of Medical Epidemiology and Biostatistics, Karolinska Institutet. My main research interests are developing and applying statistical approaches for register-based epidemiological studies, particularly in survival analysis and cost-effectiveness studies in health technology assessment. I enjoy teaching and telling stories as well. I hope you find my personal website useful to you.
