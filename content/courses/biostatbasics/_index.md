Hey friends, \
Welcome to Applied Epidemiology I Stata lab in Spring 2021. I am Enoch, your lecturer (and the one having fun with you) during this course. This is my very first time to run an entire course on a graduate level (How exciting!). Please feel free to email me (enoch.yitung.chen@ki.se) if you have any question regarding the course contents and learning materials.

I wish you enjoy this course!
