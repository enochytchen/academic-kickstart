### Title
Cancer survival statistics for patients and healthcare professionals–a tutorial of real‐world data analysis
### Authors
Eloranta S, Smedby KE, Dickman PW, Andersson TM

### Notes
1. **Why do we use net survival?** \
We want to compare survival between groups and over time.
2. **Definition of net survival**: In a hypothetical world, cancer patients can only die from the cancer of interest.
3. Comparison between
  - **Cause-specific survival**: \
  a. requires information on cause-specific deaths; deaths due to cancer/other than caner \
  b. cause-specific death is not always complete or available.
  - **Relative survival**: \
  a. does not require information on cause-specific deaths \
  b. requires a reference population, e.g., life-table data \
  c. [the mortality analogue of relative survival is excess mortality](https://enochytchen.com/post/analogue/), which captures both direct and indirect mortality due to cancer.
4. **Competeing events** \
Net survival measure is a clever way to compare survival between different groups, but in the real world, competing events exist.
5. **Loss of life expectancy**: the number of life years a cancer patient is estimated to lose.
