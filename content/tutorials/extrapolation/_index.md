### Stories behind this tutorial
I wrote these tutorial while conducting my MSc thesis project in validating different survival extrapolation methods. During my work as a master student at Karolinska Institutet, I especially benefitted from [Paul Dickman](http://pauldickman.com)'s [Stata teaching tutorials](http://pauldickman.com/software/stata/), [Therese Andersson](https://staff.ki.se/people/theran)'s [article on Statistics in Medicine (2013)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.5943)  and her [PhD thesis](https://openarchive.ki.se/xmlui/handle/10616/41668), [Paul Lambert](https://pclambert.net)'s [Interactive graphs of explaining spline functions](https://pclambert.net/interactivegraphs/spline_eg/spline_eg) , [Sandra Eloranta](https://staff.ki.se/people/sanelo) and [Hannah Bower](https://staff.ki.se/people/hanbow)'s previous analysis files. It took me time and effort to find the right way to organize and generate the information needed for extrapolation. Thus, I would like to share with people who are eager to understand how to extrapolate survival and estimate life expectancy by using flexible parametric models (```stpm2``` package in Stata).
